CompilingLauncher2
==================

A compiling version of Launcher 2 from the Android ICS source code

This app is NOT bug free. Adding widgets will crash the app (as it uses a system level permission. Maybe if you installed via root it'll work). And the app list is zoomed to different levels on different devices. It was working fine on a Nexus S a few months ago, but I changed something and now I don't remember what I did.

Any contributions and patches are welcome.
