CompilingLauncher2
==================

A compiling version of Launcher 2 from the Android ICS source code

This app is NOT bug free. Adding widgets will crash the app. And the app list is zoomed to different levels on different devices. It was working fine on a Nexus S a few months ago, but I changed something and now I don't remember what I did.

Any contributions and patches are welcome.
